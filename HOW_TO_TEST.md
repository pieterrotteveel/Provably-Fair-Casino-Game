# 🎮 Towers Game - Working Instructions

## ✅ Everything is Fixed and Ready!

### 🚀 How to Run

**Step 1: Start the server**

In your current terminal, run:
```bash
./START_SERVER.sh
```

You should see:
```
* Listening on http://127.0.0.1:3000
Use Ctrl-C to stop
```

**DON'T CLOSE THIS TERMINAL! Leave it running!**

---

**Step 2: Test in a NEW terminal**

Click the **+** icon or split terminal, then run:
```bash
./TEST_API.sh
```

---

## 📋 Manual Testing

**In Terminal 2 (while server runs in Terminal 1):**

**Create a game:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/towers/create \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"bet_amount": "10.0", "difficulty": "medium"}'
```

**Play (replace game_id):**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/towers/play \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"game_id": "1", "tile_index": 0}'
```

**Cash out:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/towers/cashout \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"game_id": "1"}'
```
